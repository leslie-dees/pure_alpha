Utilization of data scraped from Twitter, Discord, and OpenSEA to predict 72 hour price differentials of NFTs as they are minted. Data on prices are collected via OpenSEA API while social media information is collected via Twitter and Discord. Initial testing with this model proved rather ineffective due to regression resulting in a pseudo-classification of results, with price predictions inconsistent with real prices. Further testing with classification models for binary price increase or decrease will be performed to expand on this problem.
